        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These vegan cupcakes taste amazing and are quick to make! You can play around and substitute different kinds of milk, oils, and extracts; I've used my favorites in the recipe, but just about any will work. Unfortunately, this recipe doesn't rise well as a cake, but cupcakes are more fun anyway! These are great with a simple frosting of cocoa powder, powdered sugar, and orange juice.</p>
