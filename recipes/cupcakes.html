        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These vegan cupcakes taste amazing and are quick to make! You can play around and substitute different kinds of milk, oils, and extracts; I've used my favorites in the recipe, but just about any will work. Unfortunately, this recipe doesn't rise well as a cake, but cupcakes are more fun anyway! These are great with a simple frosting of cocoa powder, powdered sugar, and orange juice.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups almond milk</li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ cup coconut oil, warmed until liquid</li>
                <li>1 ¼ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 12-cup muffin pans or line with 18 paper baking cups.</li>
                <li>Pour apple cider vinegar into a 2-cup measuring cup. Fill with almond milk to make 1 1/2 cups. Let stand until curdled, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together almond milk mixture, coconut oil, and vanilla in a separate bowl. Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and stir just until blended. Spoon batter evenly into the prepared cups.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan set over a wire rack.</li>
                <li>Arrange cooled cupcakes on a serving platter. Frost with desired frosting.</li>
            </ol>
