        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Cashews are basically vegan dairy. Blend them with a little liquid and you've got a smooth cream, similar to half-and-half. Mixed with broth, nutritional yeast, miso and seasonings along with the macaroni and you've got delish mac 'n cheese.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup unroasted cashews</li>
                <li>1 cup vegetable broth</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons nutritional yeast flakes</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons white miso</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
                <li>black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>8 ounces small shell pasta or macaroni</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups arugula (Optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Description</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Blend cashews, broth, yeast, lemon juice, miso, and onion powder in a high-powered blender (such as a Vitamix®), scraping down sides with a spatula until completely smooth. Season with salt and pepper, keeping in mind that you want it just a little saltier than usual because it's going to be poured over other ingredients.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta according to package directions.</li>
                <li>Drain, return to pot, and stir in cashew sauce. Cook over low heat, stirring, until sauce thickens a bit and everything is deliciously creamy, about 3 minutes. Stir in arugula (if using) and add more salt, if needed. Serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Cook's Notes</h3>
        <p>If your blender's on the weaker side, no problem. Just soften the cashews first. Either soak them in water for 2 hours or boil them for 15 minutes, then drain before blending.</p>
        <p>You can use any type of pasta: whole wheat, gluten free, etc.</p>
